## Azure Services
### Data Factory
Data integration service that enables you to create, schedule, and manage data pipelines for efficient data movement and transformation between various sources and destinations in Azure and beyond. It simplifies ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and data integration tasks.
### Data Lake Gen 2
Data lake solution that combines the capabilities of a data lake with the power of Azure Blob Storage, allowing you to store and analyze large volumes of  structured and unstructured data with enhanced performance, security, and analytics capabilities.
### Azure Databricks
Databricks is a unified analytics platform built on top of Apache Spark, designed to help data engineers and data scientists collaborate on big data processing and building machine learning models in a collaborative and scalable environment.
### Data Synapse Analytics
SQL Data Warehouse is a cloud-based analytics service provided by Microsoft Azure. It combines big data and data warehousing into a single integrated platform, allowing organisations to analyse and process large volumes of data for business intelligence and data analytics purposes.
